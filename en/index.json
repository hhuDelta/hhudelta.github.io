However, during the incremental learning process, semantics may shift between background and object classes or vice versa. Additionally, when new classes differ significantly from pre-learned old classes, samples from new classes often lack representative feature attributes. In this paper, we propose a causal framework to discuss the causes of semantic shifts and incompleteness in IFSS and eliminate the revealed causal effects from two aspects. First, we introduce a Causal Intervention Module (CIM) to resist semantic shifts. CIM gradually and adaptively updates the prototypes of old classes, intervening to remove confounding factors. Secondly, we propose a Prototype Refinement Module (PRM) to complete missing semantics. In the PRM, knowledge obtained from the scene learning scheme helps integrate the features of new and old class prototypes. Experiments on the PASCAL-VOC 2012 and ADE20k benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Additionally, the high similarity between adjacent spectra results in information redundancy, which hinders the extraction of global spatial and spectral correlations. To address the issues of adjacent pixel mixing and spectral redundancy, this paper proposes a hyperspectral image classification method based on a global spatial-spectral attention mechanism.\nFirst, the global spatial attention module in the proposed method uses multi-scale dilated convolutions to obtain a larger receptive field, capturing global spatial correlations and extracting unmixed pixel information. Then, the global spectral attention module designs a spectral domain partitioning algorithm, which uses the product of local density and information entropy as a threshold to divide the spectrum into scattered subsets, eliminating redundant information. This approach fully utilizes the global contextual information of the entire spectral band and extracts the correlation of global spectral information.\nFinally, these two modules are combined to obtain the global correlations of both space and spectrum. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves overall accuracies of 97.28%, 94.73%, and 95.76% on three WHU-Hi hyperspectral datasets, outperforming the comparison methods.\n","date":1723593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723593600,"objectID":"a7f516b11ea8a624aa3dc94cff33623f","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/post/24-08-14/","publishdate":"2024-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/24-08-14/","section":"post","summary":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Method Based on Global Space-spectral Attention Mechanism\n","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations to Qin Rui on his paper being accepted by the Journal of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (English Edition).","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Edge Computing and Few-shot Learning Featured Intelligent Framework in Digital Twin empowered Mobile Networks\nJournal：IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management(中科院2区) Digital twins (DT) and mobile networks have evolved forms of intelligence in Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we consider a Digital Twin Mobile Network (DTMN) scenario with few multimedia samples. Facing challenges of knowledge extraction with few samples, stable interaction with dynamic changes of multimedia data, time and privacy saving in low-resource mobile network, we propose an edge computing and few-shot learning featured intelligent framework. Considering time-sensitive property of transmission and privacy risks of directly uploads in mobile network, we deploy edge computing to locally run networks for analysis, thus saving time to offload computing request and enhancing privacy by encrypting original data. Inspired by remarkable relationship representation of graphs, we build Graph Neural Network (GNN) in cloud to map physical mobile systems to virtual entities with DT, thus performing semantic inferences in cloud with few samples uploaded by edges. Occasionally, node features in GNN could converge to similar, non-discriminative embeddings, causing catastrophic unstable phenomena. An iterative reweight and drop structure (IRDS) is thus constructed in cloud, which nonetheless contributes stability with respect to edge uncertainty. As part of IRDS, a drop Edge\u0026amp;Node scheme is proposed to randomly remove certain nodes and edges, which not only enhances distinguished capability of graph neighbor patterns, but also offers data encryption with random strategy. We show one implementation case of image classification in social network, where experiments on public datasets show that our framework is effective with user-friendly advantages and significant intelligence.\n","date":1723248e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723248e3,"objectID":"53e4d73a89ee10356ec3440aaaa5c130","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/post/24-08-10/","publishdate":"2024-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/24-08-10/","section":"post","summary":"Edge Computing and Few-shot Learning Featured Intelligent Framework in Digital Twin empowered Mobile Networks\n","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations to Cao Hao for his paper being accepted by TNSM","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The China Yancheng Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, hosted by the Yancheng Municipal Government, aims to promote regional innovation development, attract global talent, and facilitate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.

However, most segmentation based methods have high computation cost in pixel-level classification and post refinements. Moreover, they still faces challenges like arbitrary directions, curved texts, illumination and so on. Aim to improve detection accuracy and computation cost, we propose an end-to-end and single-stage method named as End-PolarT network by generating contour points in polar coordinates for text detection. End-PolarT not only regress locations of contour points instead of pixels to relieve high computation cost, but also fits with intrinsic characteristics of text instances by centers and contours to suppress mislabeling boundary pixels. To cope with polar representation, we further propose polar IoU and centerness as key parts of loss functions to generate effective paradigms for text detection.

However, their lack of interpretability might bring high risk for wrong diagnosis with limited clinical knowledge embedding. In other words, we believe it's crucial for humans to interpret how deep learning work for medical analysis, thus appropriately adding knowledge constraints to correct the bias of wrong results. With such purpose, we propose Representation Group-Disentangling Network (RGD-Net) to explain the process of feature extraction and decision making inside deep learning framework, where we completely disentangle feature space of input X-ray images into independent feature groups, and each group would contribute to diagnose of a specific disease. Specifically, we first state problem definition for interpretable prediction with auto-encoder structure. Then, group-disentangled representations are extracted from input X-ray images with the proposed Group-Disentangle Module, which constructs semantic latent space by enforcing semantic consistency of attributes. Afterwards, adversarial constricts on mapping from features to diseases are proposed to prevent model collapse during training. Finally, a novel design of local tuning medical application is proposed based on RGB-Net, which is capable to aid clinicians for reasonable diagnosis. By conducting quantity of experiments on public datasets, RGD-Net have been superior to comparative studies by leveraging potential factors contributing to different diseases. We believe our work could bring interpretability in digging inherent patterns of deep learning on medical image analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Interpretable Thoracic Pathologic Prediction via Learning Group-Disentangled Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Guangchen Shi","Yirui Wu","Jun Liu","Shaohua Wan","Wehai Wang","Tong Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658793600,"objectID":"f1f45dbff130e2840add01dabf85bf48","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/publication/acmmm2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/acmmm2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Incremental few-shot semantic segmentation (IFSS) targets at incrementally expanding model's capacity to segment new class of images supervised by only a few samples. However, features learned on old classes could significantly drift, causing catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, few samples for pixel-level segmentation on new classes lead to notorious overfitting issues in each learning session. In this paper, we explicitly represent class-based knowledge for semantic segmentation as a category embedding and a hyper-class embedding, where the former describes exclusive semantical properties, and the latter expresses hyper-class knowledge as class-shared semantic properties. Aiming to solve IFSS problems, we present EHNet, i.e., Embedding adaptive-update and Hyper-class representation Network from two aspects. First, we propose an embedding adaptive-update strategy to avoid feature drift, which maintains old knowledge by hyper-class representation, and adaptively update category embeddings with a class-attention scheme to involve new classes learned in individual sessions. Second, to resist overfitting issues caused by few training samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category embeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new class for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge, thus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale. Significantly, these two designs provide representation capability for classes with sufficient semantics and limited biases, enabling to perform segmentation tasks requiring high semantic dependence. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that EHNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance with remarkable advantages.","tags":[],"title":"Incremental Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Embedding Adaptive-Update and Hyper-class Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Li","Yirui Wu","Hexuan Hu","Hu Lu","Shaohua Wan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"c2ca79dea98390d8f166305b2c3c7fbf","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/publication/bibm2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/bibm2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning methods have shown significant performance in medical image analysis tasks. However, they generally act like ”black box” without explanations in both feature extraction and decision processes, leading to lack of clinical insights and high risk assessments. To aid deep learning in envisioning diseases with visual clues, we propose Representation Group-Disentangling Network (RGD-Net), which can completely disentangle feature space of input X-ray images into several independent feature groups, each corresponding to a specific disease. Taking several semantically related and labeled X-ray images as input, RGD-Net firstly extracts completely group-disentangled representations of diseases through Group-Disentangle Module, which applies group-swap and linking operations to construct latent space by enforcing semantic consistency of attributes. To prevent learning degenerate representations defined as shortcut problem, we further introduce adversarial constricts on mapping from features to diseases, thus avoiding model collapse with former free-form disentanglement. Experiments on chestxray-14 and ChestXpert datasets demonstrate that RGD-Net are effective in predicting diseases with remarkable advantages, which leverage potential factors contributing to different diseases, thus enhancing interpretability in working patterns of deep learning methods.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Group-Disentangled Representation for Interpretable Thoracic Pathologic Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yirui Wu","Tong Lu","Zehuan Yuan","Hao Wang."],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0f68fafc00711a4e47195e056b6a1598","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/en/publication/tmm2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/tmm2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Sculpture design is challenging due to its inherent difficulty in characterizing artworks quantitatively; thus, few works have been done to assist sculpture design in the past decades in the multimedia community. We have cooperated with several sculptors on analyzing styles of different artists consisting of Giacometti, Augeuste Rodin, Henry Moore, and Marino Marini from which we find pose editing plays an important role in sculpture design. Motivated by this, we present a novel platform that allows sculptors to edit virtual three-dimensional (3-D) sculptures by a free way. The proposed platform consists of three modules, namely, sculpture initialization, sculptor-sculpture mapping, and interactive pose editing. In sculpture initialization, a virtual 3-D sculpture is first incrementally reconstructed from multiview images. Then, we define Laplace operator and its corresponding spectrum to describe the geometry information of the reconstructed sculpture. During sculptor–sculpture mapping, we apply spectral analysis on the low-frequency parts of the spectrum to search for candidate editing points on the surface of the sculpture. Next, body actions of the sculptor are captured by Kinect and further mapped onto editing points as a predefined configuration set. Finally, during interactive pose editing, a real-time Kinect-driven sculpture pose editing scheme is presented, which not only preserves geometry features of the sculpture but also allows instant changes of sculpture poses. We demonstrate that our platform successfully assists sculptors on real-time pose editing by comparing its performance with those of the existing sculpture assisting methods.","tags":[],"title":"FreeScup: A Novel Platform for Assisting Sculpture Pose Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yirui Wu","Palaiahnakote Shivakumara","Tong Lu","Chew Lim Tan","Michael Blumenstein","G.

In this paper, we aim to restore complete character contours in video/scene images from gray values, in contrast to the conventional techniques that consider edge images/binary information as inputs for text detection and recognition. We explore and utilize the strengths of zero crossing points given by the Laplacian to identify stroke candidate pixels (SPC). For each SPC pair, we propose new symmetry features based on gradient magnitude and Fourier phase angles to identify probable stroke candidate pairs (PSCP). The same symmetry properties are proposed at the PSCP level to choose seed stroke candidate pairs (SSCP). Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed for SSCP to restore complete character contours. Experimental results on benchmark databases, namely, the ICDAR family of video and natural scenes, Street View Data, and MSRA data sets, show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of both quality measures and recognition rate. We also show that character contour restoration is effective for text detection in video and natural scene images.","tags":[],"title":"Contour Restoration of Text Components for Recognition in Video/Scene Images","type":"publication"}]
