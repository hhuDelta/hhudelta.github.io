Few-shot Semantic Segmentation\nAAAI 2025 （CCF-A，人工智能领域顶会）\n增量少样本语义分割（IFSS）扩展了训练模型的分割能力，使其能够用少量样本对新的类别图像进行分割。然而，在增量学习过程中，语义可能从背景转移到对象类别或反之亦然。此外，当新类别与预学习的旧类别差异很大时，新类别的样本通常缺乏代表性的属性特征。在本文中，我们提出一个因果框架来讨论IFSS中语义偏移和不完整性的原因，并从两个方面消除揭示的因果效应。首先，我们提出一个因果干预模块（CIM）来抵抗语义偏移。CIM逐步和自适应地更新旧类别的原型，并以干预的方式去除混杂因素。其次，我们提出一个原型精炼模块（PRM）来完成缺失的语义。在PRM中，从场景学习方案中获得的知识有助于融合新旧类别原型的特征。在PASCAL-VOC

learning has achieved great success in text detection, where recent methods adopt inspirations from segmentation to detect scene texts. However, most segmentation based methods have high computation cost in pixel-level classification and post refinements. Moreover, they still faces challenges like arbitrary directions, curved texts, illumination and so on. Aim to improve detection accuracy and computation cost, we propose an end-to-end and single-stage method named as End-PolarT network by generating contour points in polar coordinates for text detection. End-PolarT not only regress locations of contour points instead of pixels to relieve high computation cost, but also fits with intrinsic characteristics of text instances by centers and contours to suppress mislabeling boundary pixels. To cope with polar representation, we further propose polar IoU and centerness as key parts of loss functions to generate effective paradigms for text detection. Compared with the existing methods, End-PolarT achieves superior results by testing on several public datasets, thus keeping balance between efficiency and effectiveness in complicated scenes.","tags":[],"title":"End-PolarT: Polar Representation for End-to-End Scene Text Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Li","巫义锐","Hexuan Hu","Hu Lu","Qian Huang","Shaohua Wan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1696118400,"objectID":"8fd5b3653529157560a419eac17f15b5","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/publication/methods2023/","publishdate":"2023-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/methods2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning has brought a significant progress in medical image analysis. However, their lack of interpretability might bring high risk for wrong diagnosis with limited clinical knowledge embedding. In other words, we believe it's crucial for humans to interpret how deep learning work for medical analysis, thus appropriately adding knowledge constraints to correct the bias of wrong results. With such purpose, we propose Representation Group-Disentangling Network (RGD-Net) to explain the process of feature extraction and decision making inside deep learning framework, where we completely disentangle feature space of input X-ray images into independent feature groups, and each group would contribute to diagnose of a specific disease. Specifically, we first state problem definition for interpretable prediction with auto-encoder structure. Then, group-disentangled representations are extracted from input X-ray images with the proposed Group-Disentangle Module, which constructs semantic latent space by enforcing semantic consistency of attributes. Afterwards, adversarial constricts on mapping from features to diseases are proposed to prevent model collapse during training. Finally, a novel design of local tuning medical application is proposed based on RGB-Net, which is capable to aid clinicians for reasonable diagnosis. By conducting quantity of experiments on public datasets, RGD-Net have been superior to comparative studies by leveraging potential factors contributing to different diseases. We believe our work could bring interpretability in digging inherent patterns of deep learning on medical image analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Interpretable Thoracic Pathologic Prediction via Learning Group-Disentangled Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Guangchen Shi","巫义锐","Jun Liu","Shaohua Wan","Wehai Wang","Tong Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1658793600,"objectID":"f1f45dbff130e2840add01dabf85bf48","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/publication/acmmm2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acmmm2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Incremental few-shot semantic segmentation (IFSS) targets at incrementally expanding model's capacity to segment new class of images supervised by only a few samples. However, features learned on old classes could significantly drift, causing catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, few samples for pixel-level segmentation on new classes lead to notorious overfitting issues in each learning session. In this paper, we explicitly represent class-based knowledge for semantic segmentation as a category embedding and a hyper-class embedding, where the former describes exclusive semantical properties, and the latter expresses hyper-class knowledge as class-shared semantic properties. Aiming to solve IFSS problems, we present EHNet, i.e., Embedding adaptive-update and Hyper-class representation Network from two aspects. First, we propose an embedding adaptive-update strategy to avoid feature drift, which maintains old knowledge by hyper-class representation, and adaptively update category embeddings with a class-attention scheme to involve new classes learned in individual sessions. Second, to resist overfitting issues caused by few training samples, a hyper-class embedding is learned by clustering all category embeddings for initialization and aligned with category embedding of the new class for enhancement, where learned knowledge assists to learn new knowledge, thus alleviating performance dependence on training data scale. Significantly, these two designs provide representation capability for classes with sufficient semantics and limited biases, enabling to perform segmentation tasks requiring high semantic dependence. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that EHNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance with remarkable advantages.","tags":[],"title":"Incremental Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Embedding Adaptive-Update and Hyper-class Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Li","巫义锐","Hexuan Hu","Hu Lu","Shaohua Wan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"c2ca79dea98390d8f166305b2c3c7fbf","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/publication/bibm2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bibm2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning methods have shown significant performance in medical image analysis tasks. However, they generally act like ”black box” without explanations in both feature extraction and decision processes, leading to lack of clinical insights and high risk assessments. To aid deep learning in envisioning diseases with visual clues, we propose Representation Group-Disentangling Network (RGD-Net), which can completely disentangle feature space of input X-ray images into several independent feature groups, each corresponding to a specific disease. Taking several semantically related and labeled X-ray images as input, RGD-Net firstly extracts completely group-disentangled representations of diseases through Group-Disentangle Module, which applies group-swap and linking operations to construct latent space by enforcing semantic consistency of attributes. To prevent learning degenerate representations defined as shortcut problem, we further introduce adversarial constricts on mapping from features to diseases, thus avoiding model collapse with former free-form disentanglement. Experiments on chestxray-14 and ChestXpert datasets demonstrate that RGD-Net are effective in predicting diseases with remarkable advantages, which leverage potential factors contributing to different diseases, thus enhancing interpretability in working patterns of deep learning methods.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Group-Disentangled Representation for Interpretable Thoracic Pathologic Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["巫义锐","Tong Lu","Zehuan Yuan","Hao Wang."],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"0f68fafc00711a4e47195e056b6a1598","permalink":"https://hhudelta.github.io/publication/tmm2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tmm2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Sculpture design is challenging due to its inherent difficulty in characterizing artworks quantitatively; thus, few works have been done to assist sculpture design in the past decades in the multimedia community. We have cooperated with several sculptors on analyzing styles of different artists consisting of Giacometti, Augeuste Rodin, Henry Moore, and Marino Marini from which we find pose editing plays an important role in sculpture design. Motivated by this, we present a novel platform that allows sculptors to edit virtual three-dimensional (3-D) sculptures by a free way. The proposed platform consists of three modules, namely, sculpture initialization, sculptor-sculpture mapping, and interactive pose editing. In sculpture initialization, a virtual 3-D sculpture is first incrementally reconstructed from multiview images. Then, we define Laplace operator and its corresponding spectrum to describe the geometry information of the reconstructed sculpture. During sculptor–sculpture mapping, we apply spectral analysis on the low-frequency parts of the spectrum to search for candidate editing points on the surface of the sculpture. Next, body actions of the sculptor are captured by Kinect and further mapped onto editing points as a predefined configuration set. Finally, during interactive pose editing, a real-time Kinect-driven sculpture pose editing scheme is presented, which not only preserves geometry features of the sculpture but also allows instant changes of sculpture poses. We demonstrate that our platform successfully assists sculptors on real-time pose editing by comparing its performance with those of the existing sculpture assisting methods.","tags":[],"title":"FreeScup: A Novel Platform for Assisting Sculpture Pose Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["巫义锐","Palaiahnakote Shivakumara","Tong Lu","Chew Lim Tan","Michael Blumenstein","G.

In this paper, we aim to restore complete character contours in video/scene images from gray values, in contrast to the conventional techniques that consider edge images/binary information as inputs for text detection and recognition. We explore and utilize the strengths of zero crossing points given by the Laplacian to identify stroke candidate pixels (SPC). For each SPC pair, we propose new symmetry features based on gradient magnitude and Fourier phase angles to identify probable stroke candidate pairs (PSCP). The same symmetry properties are proposed at the PSCP level to choose seed stroke candidate pairs (SSCP). Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed for SSCP to restore complete character contours. Experimental results on benchmark databases, namely, the ICDAR family of video and natural scenes, Street View Data, and MSRA data sets, show that the proposed technique outperforms the existing techniques in terms of both quality measures and recognition rate. We also show that character contour restoration is effective for text detection in video and natural scene images.","tags":[],"title":"Contour Restoration of Text Components for Recognition in Video/Scene Images","type":"publication"}]
