I am currently a Young Professor at Hohai University, working as member of Hydrology Big Data Group and leader of Delta Lab. I have been honored as Dayu Scholar of Hohai University. Before coming to Hohai, I obtained my Ph.D degree from Nanjing University in 2016. I received my B.S. Degree from Nanjing University in 2011 as well. During my Ph. D study, I was with the IMAGE Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Tong Lu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/index.htm) and worked closely with [Prof. Shivakumara Palaiahnakote](https://umexpert.um.edu.my/shiva). I visited HongKong University of Science and Technology twice in 2012 and 2014, supervised by [Prof. Chiew-Lan Tai](http://home.cse.ust.hk/~taicl/) and Dr. Oscar Kin-Chung Au. I've published more than 40 journal/conference papers on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Multimedia, and Intelligent Water Conservancy, including IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, ACM MM, ICME, BIBM, ICPR, ICDAR, ICIP, and others.

I am currently serving as Associate Editor for IET Image Processing(SCI, CCF-C), the first Foreign Associate Editor for Malaysian Journal of Computer Science(SCI), and the founding Associate Editor for Artificial Intelligence and Applications.
