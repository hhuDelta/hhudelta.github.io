I am currently a lecturer at Hohai University, working as a member of Delta Lab. Before coming to Hohai, I obtained my Ph.D degree from Nanjing University in 2024. I received my M.S. degree from Hohai University in 2018, and I received my B.S. degree from Xidian University in 2014. My publications appear in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing. My current research interests include pattern recognition, machine learning, and image processing.
