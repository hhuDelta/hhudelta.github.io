# Abstract
abstract: 'The rapid advancement in cyber-physical systems has led to the evolution of Industry 4.0, with a key concept being the digital twin (DT). However, linking twin simulations with real-world scenarios remains challenging, especially in tasks like small surface defect detection. This article proposes a cyber-manufacturing system with a DT solution for small surface defect detection. The system uses an Edge-Cloud architecture for efficient data collection and processing, coupled with a deep learning-based detection algorithm utilizing multi-modal data. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy and recall in small defect detection.'
