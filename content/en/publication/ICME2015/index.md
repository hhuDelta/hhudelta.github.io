# Abstract
abstract: 
  Sculpture design is challenging due to its inherent difficulty in characterizing an artwork quantitatively, and few works have been done to assist sculpture design. We present a novel platform to help sculptors in two stages, comprising automatic sculpture reconstruction and free spectral-based sculpture pose editing. During sculpture reconstruction, we co-segment a sculpture from real scene images of different views through a two-label MRF framework, aiming at performing sculpture reconstruction efficiently. During sculpture pose editing, we automatically extract candidate editing points on the sculpture by searching in the spectrums of Laplacian operator. After manually mapping body joints of a sculptor to particular editing points, we further construct a global Laplacian-based linear system by adopting the spectrums of Laplacian operator and using Kinect captured body motions for real time pose editing. The constructed system thus allows the sculptor to freely edit different kinds of sculpture artworks through Kinect. Experimental results demonstrate that our platform successfully assists sculptors in real-time pose editing.
