# Abstract
abstract: 'With a significant development of big data analysis and cloud-fog-edge computing, human-centered computing (HCC) has been a hot research topic worldwide. Essentially, HCC is a cross-disciplinary research domain, in which the core idea is to build an efficient interaction among persons, cyber space, and real world. Inspired by the improvement of HCC on big data analysis, we intend to involve related core and technologies to help solve one of the most important issues in the real world, i.e., flood prediction. To minimize the negative impacts brought by floods, researchers pay special attention to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting with quantity of technologies including HCC. However, historical flood data is essentially imbalanced. Imbalanced data causes machine learning classifiers to be more biased towards patterns with majority samples, resulting in poor classification of pattern with minority samples. In this paper, we propose a novel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)-Boost-based sparse Bayesian model to perform flood prediction with both high accuracy and robustness. The proposed model consists of three modules, namely, SMOTE-based data enhancement, AdaBoost training strategy, and sparse Bayes model construction. In SMOTE-based data enhancement, we adopt a SMOTE algorithm to effectively cover diverse data modes and generate more samples for prediction pattern with minority samples, which greatly alleviates the problem of imbalanced data by involving experts’ analysis and users’ intentions. During AdaBoost training strategy, we propose a specifically designed AdaBoost training strategy for sparse Bayesian model, which not only adaptively and incrementally increases prediction ability of Bayesian model, but also prevents its overfitting performance. Essentially, the design of AdaBoost strategy helps keep balance between prediction ability and model complexity, which offers different but effective models over diverse rivers and users. Finally, we construct a sparse Bayesian model based on AdaBoost training strategy, which could offer flood prediction results with high rationality and robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model for flood prediction by conducting experiments on a collected dataset with several comparative methods.'
