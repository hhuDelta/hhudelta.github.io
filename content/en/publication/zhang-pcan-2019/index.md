abstract: Point cloud based retrieval for place recognition is an emerging problem
  in vision field. The main challenge is how to find an efficient way to encode the
  local features into a discriminative global descriptor. In this paper, we propose
  a Point Contextual Attention Network (PCAN), which can predict the significance
  of each local point feature based on point context. Our network makes it possible
  to pay more attention to the task-relevent features when aggregating local features.
  Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed network can provide
  outperformance than current state-of-the-art approaches.
