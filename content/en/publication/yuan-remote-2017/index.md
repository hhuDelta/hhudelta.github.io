abstract: Due to the high intraclass variability and the low interclass disparity
  in high-resolution remote sensing (RS) image scenes, high-resolution RS scene classification
  is a challenging task. The performance of scene classification not only relies on
  discriminative feature representation but also needs appropriate classification
  strategies. In this paper, a scene preclassification strategy based on unsupervised
  learning is proposed, which divides scenes into two groups. The division method
  called dynamic-sphere division method (DSDM) is based on a dynamic-sphere division
  and an inside-sphere membership assessment. For the group with lower membership,
  after introducing the spatial location and scale of the scale invariant feature
  transformation (SIFT) descriptor to form a transaction, frequent itemset mining
  and an improved feature selection criterion are implemented to reduce the redundancy
  from the aspects of feature quantity and feature dimension, and a more discriminative
  structural feature histogram FMS-hist is finally obtained. Both the radius of the
  dynamic-sphere and the final optimal feature dimension are automatically selected
  according to the inflection point of the corresponding curves. Experimental results
  based on two representative data sets show that the proposed DSDM can select the
  suitable group, the proposed FMS-hist is superior to the bag-of-SIFT-based models.
  The holistic procedure can further enhance the scene classification accuracy.
