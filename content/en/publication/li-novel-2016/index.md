abstract: With the development of remote sensing (RS) techniques, the amount of RS
  images increases dramatically. It is a challenge to utilize those RS big data efficiently.
  Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a typical approximate similarity search
  problem, which needs to establish an effective index structure to reduce the time
  of retrieval. By analyzing the limitations of commonly-used indexing mechanisms
  in the current CBIR system, we propose a novel scheme that dynamically combines
  vantage point tree (vp-tree) indexes to CBIR by using spacing-correlation strategies
  to determine the vantage points. Borrowing ideas from feature selection, we have
  also put forward a new measure to adaptively online select proper vp-tree indexing
  in different feature spaces, the distance-contrast-based indexing validity index
  (DCIVI). And we then employ vp-tree index structure in each feature space, which
  can properly describe the content of the RS image by the chosen features. Experimental
  results on various typical land covers retrieval validate that the proposed method
  is effective and not only is the response speed increased by 70 100 times, but also
  the retrieval quality (in terms of precision and recall) is improved.
