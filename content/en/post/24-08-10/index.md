Digital twins (DT) and mobile networks have evolved forms of intelligence in Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we consider a Digital Twin Mobile Network (DTMN) scenario with few multimedia samples. Facing challenges of knowledge extraction with few samples, stable interaction with dynamic changes of multimedia data, time and privacy saving in low-resource mobile network, we propose an edge computing and few-shot learning featured intelligent framework. Considering time-sensitive property of transmission and privacy risks of directly uploads in mobile network, we deploy edge computing to locally run networks for analysis, thus saving time to offload computing request and enhancing privacy by encrypting original data. Inspired by remarkable relationship representation of graphs, we build Graph Neural Network (GNN) in cloud to map physical mobile systems to virtual entities with DT, thus performing semantic inferences in cloud with few samples uploaded by edges. Occasionally, node features in GNN could converge to similar, non-discriminative embeddings, causing catastrophic unstable phenomena. An iterative reweight and drop structure (IRDS) is thus constructed in cloud, which nonetheless contributes stability with respect to edge uncertainty. As part of IRDS, a drop Edge&Node scheme is proposed to randomly remove certain nodes and edges, which not only enhances distinguished capability of graph neighbor patterns, but also offers data encryption with random strategy. We show one implementation case of image classification in social network, where experiments on public datasets show that our framework is effective with user-friendly advantages and significant intelligence.
