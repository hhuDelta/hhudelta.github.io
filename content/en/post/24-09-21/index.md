The Digital Twin Watershed refers to the digital mapping and intelligent simulation of all elements within a physical watershed and the entire process of water governance and management activities. Centering on the construction of digital twin watersheds, the focus lies on how intelligent simulation technology, through big data analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms, enables real-time monitoring and prediction of multidimensional data such as hydrology, water quality, and the environment within the watershed. Specific case studies highlight the remarkable achievements of intelligent technology in areas like flood forecasting and ecological protection. In light of the characteristics of current pre-trained large models, the future development trends of digital twin and intelligent simulation technologies in watershed management are also explored.
