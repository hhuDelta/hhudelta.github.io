 abstract = {Point cloud-based place recognition is a fundamental part of the localization task, and it can be achieved through a retrieval process. Reranking is a critical step in improving the retrieval accuracy, yet little effort has been devoted to reranking in point cloud retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the versatility of rigid registration in reranking the point cloud retrieval results. Specifically, after obtaining the initial retrieval list based on the global point cloud feature distance, we perform registration between the query and point clouds in the retrieval list. We propose an efficient strategy based on visual consistency to evaluate each registration with a registration score in an unsupervised manner. The final reranked list is computed by considering both the original global feature distance and the registration score. In addition, we find that the registration score between two point clouds can also be used as a pseudo label to judge whether they represent the same place. Thus, we can create a self-supervised training dataset when there is no ground truth of positional information. Moreover, we develop a new probability-based loss to obtain more discriminative descriptors. The proposed reranking approach and the probability-based loss can be easily applied to current point cloud retrieval baselines to improve the retrieval accuracy. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that both the reranking registration method and probability-based loss can significantly improve the current state-of-the-art baselines.},
