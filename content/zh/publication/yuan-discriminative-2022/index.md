abstract: With the rapid development of multimedia technologies (e.g. deep learning),
  Feature Selection (FS) is now playing a critical role in acquiring discriminative
  features from massive data. Traditional FS methods score feature importance and
  select the top best features by treating all instances equally; Hence, valuable
  instances like directional outliers (DOs), which are specific outliers closer to
  other class centres than to their owns, seldom receive particular attention during
  feature selection. Based on our observation, DOs derive from “misclassified instances”
  which lead to misclassification. In this paper, we present a novel supervised feature
  selection method entitled Feature Selection via Directional Outliers Correcting
  (FSDOC), for accurate data classification. The proposed FSDOC includes an optimization
  algorithm to capture DOs, and two correcting algorithms to reasonably capture redundant
  features by correcting DOs with intraclass deviation minimization and interclass
  relative distance maximization. We give theoretical guarantees and adequate analysis
  on all algorithms to show the effectiveness of FSDOC. Extensive experiments on fifteen
  public datasets, and two case studies of deep features and very-high dimensional
  Fisher Vector selection, demonstrate the superior performance of FSDOC.
