abstract: Feature selection (FS) has recently attracted considerable attention in
  many fields. Highly-overlapping classes and skewed distributions of data within
  classes have been found in various classification tasks. Most existing FS methods
  are all instance-based, which ignores the significant differences in characteristics
  between the particular outliers and the main body of the class, causing confusion
  for classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised FS method, Intrusive
  Outliers-based Feature Selection (IOFS), to find out what kind of outliers lead
  to misclassification and exploit the characteristics of such outliers. In order
  to accurately identify the intrusive outliers (IOs), we provide a density-mean center
  algorithm to obtain the appropriate representative of a class. A special distance
  threshold is given to obtain the candidate for IOs. Combining with several metrics,
  mathematical formulations are provided to evaluate the overlapping degree of the
  intrusive class pairs. Features with high overlapping degrees are assigned to low
  rankings in IOFS method. An extension of IOFS based on a small number of extreme
  IOs, called E-IOFS, is also proposed. Three theoretical proofs are provided for
  the essential theoretical basis of IOFS. Experiments comparing against various state-of-the-art
  methods on eleven benchmark datasets show that IOFS is rational and effective, especially
  on the datasets with higher overlapping classes. And E-IOFS almost always outperforms
  IOFS.
