# Abstract
abstract: In hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, pixel interactions within defined spatial extents result in the mixing of adjacent pixels. Additionally, the high similarity of adjacent spectra leads to information redundancy, which hinders the extraction of global spatial and spectral correlations. In order to solve the problems of mixed adjacent pixels and redundant adjacent spectra, this work offers a hyperspectral image classification approach that uses a global space-spectral attention mechanism. First, the proposed methodâ€™s global spatial attention module uses multi-scale dilated convolution to produce a bigger receptive field to be capable of capturing global spatial correlation and obtain unmixed pixel information. Then, the global spectral attention module designs a spectral domain partition algorithm, using the combination of regional density as well as information entropy as the threshold to divide spectrum into dispersed subsets and eliminate redundant information. The global context information for entire spectral band is fully exploited, and correlation of the global spectral information is extracted. Finally, the two modules combine to provide a global correlation of space and spectrum. Experiments demonstrate that the suggested method obtains overall accuracies of 97.28%, 94.73%, and 95.76% on the three WHU-Hi hyperspectral datasets, surpassing comparison methods.
