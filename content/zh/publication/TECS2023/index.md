# Abstract
abstract: 'Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild poses significant challenges due to realistic occlusions, illumination, scale, and head pose variations of the facial images. In this article, we propose an Edge-AI-driven framework for FER. On the algorithms aspect, we propose two attention modules, Arbitrary-oriented Spatial Pooling (ASP) and Scalable Frequency Pooling (SFP), for effective feature extraction to improve classification accuracy. On the systems aspect, we propose an edge-cloud joint inference architecture for FER to achieve low-latency inference, consisting of a lightweight backbone network running on the edge device, and two optional attention modules partially offloaded to the cloud. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a good balance between classification accuracy and inference latency.'
