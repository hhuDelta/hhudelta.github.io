I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Jiangsu University of Science and Technology in 2023. I am currently studying for my Master's degree and am a member of the Delta Lab under Professor Yirui Wu.
I often post my projects on Github. If you are interested, you can communicate with me through email or post an issue.
